# magnet-winforms
A .NET sticky forms that actually works

Features
~~~~~~~~
- Edge-to-edge and edge-to-corner magnets
- Joint move and resize of child from when main form moves or resizes
- Simple and clean implementation

Usage
~~~~~
Simply include MagnetWinForms.cs in your project and create an instance in the form constructor, ie:
'''csharp
public Form()
{
	InitializeComponent();

	m_MagnetWinForms = new MagnetWinForms(this);
}
'''
NOTE: While all forms need to create a MagnetWinForms instance, the Main form should be the first one to do it.
